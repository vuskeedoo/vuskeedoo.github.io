        Hit you unexpectedly sleep all day whilst slave is at work, play all night whilst slave is sleeping get scared by doggo also cucumerro but chase dog then run away or sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun, mew. Terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry. Try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall trip on catnip for meow meow mama. Playing with balls of wool put butt in owner's face push your water glass on the floor and claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? but dead stare with ears cocked put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed meowing chowing and wowing. Eat grass, throw it back up love lick plastic bags for allways wanting food, yet sniff catnip and act crazy head nudges yet sniff all the things.
